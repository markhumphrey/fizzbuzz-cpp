Relatively simple implementation of the classic FizzBuzz interview question in
C++. Refactored to be testable and flexible enough to solve slight alterations
to the FizzBuzz problem. This refactoring could be taken much further, but .

The source code is broken up into the directories described below. Overkill for
this small project, but the cleanest method as the unit tests need their own
main prog and can't exist in the same project.

Directory structure:
fizzbuzz/ - Implementation of FizzBuzz algorithm in DivisibleCheck class
fizzbuzz-main/ - Simple main prog that sets up and uses DivisibleCheck
fizzbuzz-test/ - Unit tests written for DivisibleCheck using google-test
